Applets and Applications 

Java applets are programs that are designed to be embedded in an HTML 
document. Java applications are standalone programs. Java applications can be 
console programs that only support text output to the command line, or they can 
be window-based applications with a GUI.

Object-Oriented Programs 

Java programs are intrinsically object-oriented. Object-oriented programs are 
implemented in terms of problem-specifi c types of data rather that primitive 
types such as characters and numerical values.
Classes A class is a defi nition of a particular type of object. A class contains 
specifi cations for the type of data needed to defi ne an object of the type and 
defi nes the operations that you can carry out on objects.

Class Methods 

A class method is a block of code within a class defi nition that specifi es an 
operation for an object of the class type.

Constructors 

A constructor is a special kind of method within a class defi nition that can create 
objects of the class type.

Java Source Files 

Java source code is stored in fi les with the extension .java.

Compiled Java Code 

Java programs are compiled to bytecodes, which are instructions for the .JVM. 
The JVM is the same on all the computers on which it is implemented, thus 
ensuring the portability of Java programs.

Java Object Code 

Files Java object code is stored in fi les with the extension .class.

Java Program Execution 

Java programs are executed by the Java interpreter, which analyzes the 
bytecodes and carries out the operations they specify.

Unicode 

Unicode is a 16-bit character encoding that enables multiple national language 
character sets to be supported. Java source programs are represented internally 
as Unicode and Java supports programming applications with multilingual 
capability
